# Snake-Survivor
In Snake-Survivor, you control a snake that will navigate while avoiding clashes with other snakes. Use your keyboard to guide your snake and try to stay one step ahead of your hunters. The game ends when one of the other snakes catches you. If the other snake does not catch you within the time period of the level you ascend to the next level. Can you outwit your enemies and escape to safety?
